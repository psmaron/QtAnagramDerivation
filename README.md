# QtAnagramDerivation
An anagram derivation is a N-letter word derived from a N-1 letter word by adding a letter and rearranging. For example, here is a derivation of "aliens​": 
ail​ ​+​ ​s​ ​=​ ​sail​ ​+​ ​n​ ​=​ ​nails​ ​+​ ​e​ ​=​ ​aliens  
  
This program finds the longest such derivation from a specific 3-letter word (one word provided by user) in a list of words where every derived word also exists in the list of words. words = {ail, tennis, nails, desk, aliens, table, engine, sail, etc....}   

Code is littered with comments explaining the algorithm step by step.
